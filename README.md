# Pub Quiz 

This application is a trivia game where, users are allowed to set up an account and designate a team name.  They can then request to join a particular quiz.  Once the game has started, the team will receive a question and has a set amount of time to answer before they automatically get a wrong answer. And the administrator can add teams to a quiz.  They can distribute questions manually or automatically from an API.  They can also set up a tournament and control how many quizzes are in each tournament.
